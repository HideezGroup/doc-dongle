# About Hideez Dongle

Hideez Dongle is a special accessory for:\
\- adding Bluetooth 4.0 to Mac and Windows PCs that are not Bluetooth 4.0 compatible\
\- replacing internal Bluetooth connection that's not stable/sufficient enough\
\
Works perfectly with the [Hideez Key 3](https://hideez.com/products/hideez-key-3) and [Hideez Key 4](https://hideez.com/products/hideez-key-4).

**BLE Technology**\
Bluetooth Low Energy allows your devices to remain paired to each other without a continual stream of data being transferred, decreasing power consumption on both Hideez Key and your PC.

\
**High compatibility**\
Hideez Dongle works with macOS and Windows 10 laptops or desktop computers via a standard USB 2.0 or 3.0 port.

[Windows](how-to-use-hideez-bluetooth-dongle-on-windows/) and [Mac](how-to-use-hideez-bluetooth-dongle-on-macos/) setup is only needed if you want to use Hideez Dongle as a standalone analogy to your internal Bluetooth.
